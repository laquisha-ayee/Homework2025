Hey. Where my homework at?

Im working on it today! I should be caught up by the time we start class today ! (Yay!)

Did you have any issues or comments about the code/concepts your are working? Let me know if I should add/discuss anything in particular.

Also, when you get a chance, your coding schedule for the upcoming week... (and I just noticed this is public, you need to set this repo to private)
